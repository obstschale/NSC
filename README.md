I've upgraded scripts to use `Python 3` because macOS 12.3 dropped `Python 2`. And I prefer to use a short version of command like `dec` and `bin` instead of `decimal` and `binary`.

## Introduction

*NSC* is a little [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to convert a number into another number system. I study computer science and therefore I daily deal with different number systems. The most common ones are probably `binary`, `octal`, `decimal`, and `hexadecimal` but I got tiered to calculate them by hand, calculator or a webpage. Alfred is only a key stroke away and so I started programming this workflow.


I started to learn Python and to pratice that the new Alfred 2 workflow is written in Python. So your welcome to send a pull request if you have any improvement done.

## Functions

Like I mentioned above, you can convert numbers. In the first version I implemented `binary`, `decimal`, and `hexadecimal`. And you can even convert any number from any system into another.

## Usage

But how can I use NSC? It is really simple.

You call NSC with the different keywords (this is new in v2.0) and according the number you want to convert. E.g. if you want to convert a decimal number you just type `decimal` and the `number`. Alfred 2 will show instantly the converted number in `binary`, `octal`, and even `hex`.

So the 4 basic keywords are:

* `decimal`
* `binary`
* `octal`
* `hex`

and it looks like that:

I really love this feature, displaying live updates in Alfred :)

Beside these 4 keywords a fifth is implemented: `convert`. It is used if a number needs to be converted which is no to base 2, 8, 10 or 16. It uses the following syntax:

	`convert` `number` `base of number` `base of new system`

Imagine it like a sentence: _Convert number X with base B into system with base Y_

_Convert 42 with base 6 into system with base 4_

### Clipboard and Notification
Another cool feature of Alfred 2 is that you can pass arguments to other parts of your workflow. In case of NSC, if you select a result and click `enter`, the number will be copied to your clipboard and a notification will pop up.

### Examples

* `decimal 10` → result: B: 1010 // O: 12 // H: a

* `binary 1011` → result: D: 11 // O: 13 // H: b

* `octal 150` → result: D: 104 // B: 1101000 // H: 68

* `hex FF2` → result: D: 4082 // B: 111111110010 // O: 7762

* `convert 119 11 3` → result: D: 141 // Base 3: 12020
